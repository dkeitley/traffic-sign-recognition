# Improved Shallow Network for Fast Traffic Sign Recognition

This repository contains work completed in 2018 out as part of the *COMSM0018 Applied Deep Learning* module at the University of Bristol.

Using Tensorflow, we implement a convolutional neural network for classifying traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTRSB) dataset. The model is inspired from the architecture of Zhang et al. [1].

See [report.pdf](report.pdf) for more details.
